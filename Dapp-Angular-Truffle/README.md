## __Common errors and their solutions__

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../../../../Blockchain/build/contracts/Payment.json'` during `ng serve` | Run `truffle compile` |
| `Error: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce.` in MetaMask | Reset MetaMask: Settings -> Reset Account //Warning only with test accounts |
| `Error getting balance; see log.` in UI, with `Error: MetaCoin has not been deployed to detected network (network/artifact mismatch)` in browser console | Ensure you have started ganache, run `truffle migrate` and configured MetaMask to point to ganache | `Error: i cannot see my account or balance` Ensure you are logged in metamask and refresh | If you have a custom rcp in ganache you can change the dir in `src/app/contract/contract.service.ts line21 with your dir `| `Error: [ethjs-rpc] rpc error with payload` in Metamask | You may need update Ganache and restart metamask because some old vesions give 0 gas and the transaction is mark as  underpriced the error givet is errot with payload we recomend use the newest version of ganache cli  |
